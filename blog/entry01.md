# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Software engineering)
##### 10/26/23

## Choosing the topic

The topic I choose for this project is electrical engineering because I've been fasinated with engineering and also enjoyed creating stuff that involved eletricity. I've been interested in engineering since the day I found out it exsisted when someone mentioned it to me. It was pretty easy for me to incorporate technology as elevtrical engineering uses electricity.
